            <p>Kenya conservatory is a website that seeks to teach the world about our local wildlife within the current borders of <strong>Eastern Africa</strong>, 
                <br>and to further teach future generations about our wildlife giving them a sound safe platform from which information can be attained in a manner suitable for the present and future.<br></p>
            
                <p>In recent years we have seen the decline of wildlife due to poaching and other malicious activites, and while some of the activities like farming
                    <br>may not be considered harmful, going unchecked as an economic activity has been seen to be highly detrimental.<br></p>
